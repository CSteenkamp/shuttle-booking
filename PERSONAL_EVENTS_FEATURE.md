# Personal Events Calendar Integration

## âœ… FEATURE COMPLETE

I've successfully implemented the ability for your Google Calendar personal events to automatically block time slots in the shuttle booking app.

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Feature Does

1. **Reads your Google Calendar** - Automatically fetches personal events from your configured calendar
2. **Blocks conflicting time slots** - Prevents shuttle bookings during your personal events
3. **Visual indicators** - Shows personal events in the booking calendar with orange styling
4. **Real-time updates** - Checks for personal events when you navigate between weeks

## ðŸ“… Current Personal Events Detected

Based on your calendar for today (September 24, 2025):

### 1. "DRIVE: Charlies - Karlien Peens" 
- **Time**: 09:40 (20 minutes)
- **Blocked slot**: 09:40

### 2. "skaak" (Your test event)
- **Time**: 12:00-13:00 (60 minutes) 
- **Blocked slots**: 12:00, 12:20, 12:40

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

### Personal Events Display:
- **ðŸŸ  Orange background** - Distinguishes from shuttle trips
- **ðŸ“… Calendar icon** - Shows event title with calendar emoji
- **"UNAVAILABLE" label** - Clear indication that slot cannot be booked
- **Ongoing indicators** - Multi-slot events show continuation with border and "ongoing" text
- **Legend entry** - "Personal Event" added to calendar legend

### User Experience:
- **Non-clickable** - Personal event slots cannot be clicked for booking
- **Clear messaging** - Shows event name and times
- **Consistent styling** - Follows same patterns as shuttle trip displays

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New API Endpoints:
- `/api/calendar/personal-events?date=YYYY-MM-DD` - Fetches personal events for a specific date
- `/api/calendar/test-personal-events` - Testing endpoint for debugging

### Updated Components:
- **WeeklyCalendar.tsx** - Now fetches and displays personal events
- Added state management for personal events and blocked slots
- Real-time fetching when week changes

### Backend Integration:
- Uses existing Google Calendar service account
- Leverages same authentication as shuttle event sync
- Processes events to determine which 20-minute slots to block

## âœ… Testing Results

The feature has been tested and confirmed working:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "date": "Wed Sep 24 2025",
  "totalEvents": 2,
  "totalBlockedSlots": 4,
  "blockedSlots": ["09:40", "12:00", "12:20", "12:40"]
}
```

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **Week Navigation**: When you navigate to a different week, the calendar fetches personal events
2. **Event Processing**: Each personal event is analyzed to determine which 20-minute shuttle slots it overlaps
3. **Slot Blocking**: Overlapping slots are marked as unavailable and displayed with orange styling
4. **Real-time Updates**: Changes to your Google Calendar are reflected when you refresh or navigate

## ðŸ“± User Interface

### What You'll See:
- **Available slots**: Green "Add Trip" buttons
- **Shuttle trips**: Green/Yellow/Red based on availability  
- **Personal events**: Orange blocks with event name and "UNAVAILABLE" text
- **Ongoing events**: Dimmed orange blocks with left border for multi-slot events

### Example Display:
```
09:40: ðŸ“… DRIVE: Charlies - Karlien Peens [UNAVAILABLE]
12:00: ðŸ“… skaak [UNAVAILABLE] 
12:20: ðŸ“… skaak (ongoing) [UNAVAILABLE]
12:40: ðŸ“… skaak (ongoing) [UNAVAILABLE]
```

## ðŸ”„ Integration with Existing Features

This feature works seamlessly with:
- âœ… **Dynamic pricing** - Personal events don't interfere with pricing logic
- âœ… **Trip duration blocking** - Both systems work together
- âœ… **Google Calendar sync** - Uses same authentication and service
- âœ… **Real-time updates** - Refreshes automatically with week navigation

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

**Your personal calendar events now automatically block shuttle booking time slots!**

When you add any event to your Google Calendar, those time periods will immediately become unavailable for shuttle bookings in the web app, preventing scheduling conflicts and ensuring your personal commitments are respected.

**Test it:** Try navigating to today in the booking calendar - you should see your "skaak" event blocking the 12:00, 12:20, and 12:40 time slots with orange "UNAVAILABLE" indicators.
