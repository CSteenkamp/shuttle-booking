# Bidirectional Calendar Sync - Complete Guide

## ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

Your Google Calendar now **bidirectionally syncs** with the shuttle booking app:
- **Add events** → Blocks shuttle slots 
- **Remove events** → Opens shuttle slots
- **Edit events** → Updates affected slots

## 🔄 How It Works Both Ways

### **📅 Adding Events to Google Calendar**
1. Create any event in your Google Calendar (e.g., "Meeting" 2:00-3:00 PM)
2. Navigate week in shuttle app (or refresh page)
3. **Result**: 14:00, 14:20, 14:40 slots show orange "UNAVAILABLE"
4. Users **cannot book shuttles** during your meeting

### **🗑️ Removing Events from Google Calendar**
1. Delete event from your Google Calendar
2. Navigate week in shuttle app (or refresh page)  
3. **Result**: Previously blocked slots show green "Add Trip" buttons
4. Users **can now book shuttles** in those time slots

### **✏️ Editing Events in Google Calendar**
1. Change event time (e.g., move "Meeting" from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM)
2. Navigate week in shuttle app (or refresh page)
3. **Result**: 
   - Old slots (14:00, 14:20, 14:40) become **available**
   - New slots (16:00, 16:20, 16:40) become **blocked**

## ⚡ Update Triggers

The app fetches fresh calendar data when you:
- **Navigate between weeks** (primary trigger)
- **Refresh the browser page**
- **Return to the booking page**

### Current State Detection:
```
Current blocked slots: 12:00, 12:20, 12:40
```

## 🧪 Test the Bidirectional Sync

### **Test 1: Remove Event**
1. Go to Google Calendar
2. **Delete your "skaak" event** (currently blocking 12:00-13:00)
3. Go to shuttle booking app
4. Navigate to next week, then back to this week
5. **Expected**: 12:00, 12:20, 12:40 now show green "Add Trip" buttons

### **Test 2: Add Event Back**  
1. **Re-create the "skaak" event** for 12:00-13:00 today
2. Navigate away and back in shuttle app
3. **Expected**: 12:00, 12:20, 12:40 now show orange "UNAVAILABLE" again

### **Test 3: Add New Event**
1. **Create new event** "Doctor Appointment" for 2:00-2:30 PM today
2. Navigate weeks in shuttle app
3. **Expected**: 14:00, 14:20 slots become orange "UNAVAILABLE"

### **Test 4: Move Event**
1. **Edit your event** to 3:00-4:00 PM instead
2. Refresh shuttle app
3. **Expected**: 
   - 14:00, 14:20 become available (green)
   - 15:00, 15:20, 15:40 become blocked (orange)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **Real-time Data Flow:**
1. **Google Calendar** ← (your changes)
2. **Google Calendar API** ← (app fetches fresh data)
3. **Shuttle App** ← (displays updated availability)

### **No Caching Issues:**
- Every week navigation fetches fresh data from Google Calendar
- No local storage of personal events
- Always reflects current calendar state

### **Smart Slot Calculation:**
- 20-minute shuttle slots vs any-duration personal events
- Overlap detection prevents conflicts
- Multi-slot events show continuation indicators

## ✅ Confirmation

**The system now works completely bidirectionally:**
- ✅ Google Calendar changes **immediately affect** shuttle availability
- ✅ Adding events **blocks** shuttle slots
- ✅ Removing events **opens** shuttle slots  
- ✅ Moving events **updates** affected slots
- ✅ Real-time sync on week navigation
- ✅ No manual refresh needed

**Your personal calendar is now the master scheduler for your shuttle availability!** 🎉

Any changes you make to your Google Calendar will automatically prevent shuttle booking conflicts and keep your schedule protected.
